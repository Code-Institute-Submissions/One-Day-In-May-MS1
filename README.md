# One Day In May

My project is aimed at supporters of Ipswich Town Football Club.  The club and fans recently marked 20 years since they won promotion to the Premier League with former players joining podcasts and local radio stations to discuss their team mates, the highs and lows of the thrilling trilogy of playoff matches and the celebrations that followed.

My website serves as a hub for fans to relive the experience and for younger fans who weren't around at the time, to learn about what happened and who the players were.  Along with the homepage, I have focused on 3 pages:
- Highlights - I have embedded YouTube highlights of the 3 games and a description of what happened in each.
- Meet the Players - This page introduces some of the key players and their contributions.  There is a photo gallery for each player.
- Share - I invite users to share their memories of the playoffs by completing a form.

## UX

The website is aimed at ITFC fans so I envisage users will be a variety of age ranges.  I envisage many users accessing the site on their mobile phones, perhaps during half-time of a match.  I have tried to make each page bitesize so users do not need to scroll down pages of text.

Since the name of the website doesn't make it immediately clear that it is for ITFC fans, I have tried to grab users attention to let them know.  On the home page, I have used a jumbotron showing players celebrating and I have used club colours in the navigation bar.  On medium sized screens upwards, the navigation bar also features the club badge.

I want users to quickly learn what content the site hosts - otherwise they may leave.  To address this, I have included a brief introduction on the home page followed by links to each of the 3 pages and a short explanation of what each page contains.

### Features for future implementation

If I was to continue the development of this website, I would look to add:
- A page for users to buy merchandise and memorabilia such as kits, matchday programmes, etc.
- A "Your Memories" page containing the photos and memories that people have uploaded to the website.
- A "What Happened Next" page which explains what happened to the team and the players after winning promotion.

## Technologies Used

I used the following languages, frameworks and libraries to build this website:
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - HTML5 was used to code the content of the website.
