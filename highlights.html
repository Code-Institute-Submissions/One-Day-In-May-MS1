                        <p>Three successive campaigns in the Premier League came to an end in the 1994-95 season when Ipswich finished bottom of the then 22 team league.  The season included a humiliating Premier League record 9-0 defeat to Manchester United.  George Burley, a former player under Sir Bobby Robson during the club’s golden period of the late 70’s and early 80’s, had been appointed as manager in December 1994 with assistant Dale Roberts.  Having taken over the reins from John Lyall, Burley was unable to turn the teams form around as they achieved only 7 wins and 3 clean sheets all season conceding 93 goals in the league.</p>
                        <img class="float-none float-sm-right rounded mx-0 ml-sm-3 mb-3 text-image" src="assets/images/background/burley-and-sheepshanks.jpg" alt="Ipswich manager George Burley with chairman David Sheepshanks.">
                        <p>The summer of 1995 saw David Sheepshanks appointed as chairman.  Over the coming seasons, the trio of Sheepshanks, Burley and Roberts would guide the club to several play-off place finishes in England’s second tier, then known as Division 1.  Burley looked to improve the squad with a few key signings each season as well as utilising the club’s academy.  However, promotion back to the Premier League remained allusive following several successive seasons which ended in play-off heartache.</p>
                        <p>The 1995-96 season saw teenage goalkeeper Richard Wright and striker James Scowcroft break into the first team making 23 and 27 appearances respectively.  Centre back Tony Mowbray arrived from Celtic to help fix a leaky defence.  In his first full season as manager, Burley guided Ipswich to 7th place, just 2 points short of the play-off places.</p>

                        <p>Academy products Kieron Dyer and Richard Naylor made their first appearances in an Ipswich shirt during the 1996-97 season.  Ipswich finished 4th in the league to set up a play-off tie against Sheffield United.  A 1-1 draw at Bramall Lane followed by a 2-2 draw at Portman Road saw Ipswich lose out on a shot at the Premier League at Wembley by virtue of the away goals rule.</p>
                        <p>The 1997-98 season saw Ipswich place 5th but once more we failed to make the play-off final at Wembley following two 1-0 defeats to Charlton Athletic in the play-offs semi-finals.  The season included the 5-0 “Demolition Derby” victory over Norwich at Portman Road in February 1998 in which striker Alex Mathie scored a first half hattrick.  Midfielder and future captain Matt Holland along with centre back Mark Venus both arrived at the start of the campaign with forward David Johnson and left back Jamie Clapham signing during the season.</p>
                        <p>Midfield playmaker Jim Magilton signed in March 1999 following a short loan spell.  The 1998-99 season saw Ipswich finish 3rd in the league, 1 point behind Bradford City in the automatic promotion places.  Bolton Wanderers, a team who finished 6th and 10 points behind Ipswich, were the opponents in the play-offs.  A 1-0 away defeat in the first leg was followed up by a 7-goal thriller at Portman Road which saw Ipswich win 4-3.  However, the away goals rule would strike again allowing Bolton to progress to the play-off final against Watford, to whom they would lose to at Wembley.</p>

                        <p>Following three failed play-off attempts, two of which had been determined by the away goals rule, club chairman David Sheepshanks instigated an initiative which would see the away goals rule abolished from football league play-offs.</p>
                        <p>In July 1999, Kieron Dyer was sold to Newcastle United for a then club record fee of £6m.  The sale was used to fund several key signings; defenders John McGreal and Gary Croft plus midfielder Jermaine Wright all arrived for sums exceeding £0.5m.  Striker Marcus Stewart was signed for £2.75m from Huddersfield Town in February 2000.  Finally, winger Martijn Reuser was signed on loan from Ajax in March 2000 for the remainder of the season.</p>
                        <p>Once again Ipswich were in the hunt for automatic promotion.  Charlton Athletic would secure automatic promotion with 2 games to spare and would go up as champions.  Going into the season’s final day, Ipswich were in third place, 2 points behind Manchester City.  Final day victory for both teams meant Ipswich once again fell short of an automatic promotion spot and would have to pick themselves up for another play-off semi-final tie with Bolton Wanderers.</p>

                                        <p>Bolton Wanderers were unbeaten in the last 6 games of the league season, winning 5, to lift themselves into a play-off place on the final day of the season.  Sam Allardyce had taken over as manager in October 1999 and possessed a powerful front two of Dean Holdsworth and Eidur Gudjohnsen who had netted 14 league goals each during the campaign.  Behind them was the creative talent of Danish midfielder Claus Jensen.</p>
                                        <p>After 5 minutes, Bolton Wanderers took a 1-0 lead with their first attack of the game through talisman Holdsworth.  On 26 minutes, Eidur Gudjohnsen fashioned some space on the edge of the box to slot home and give Bolton a 2-goal advantage.  Tony Mowbray had been forced off early on through injury and on 32 minutes, David Johnson’s game was cut short following a robust duel with Bolton defender Mark Fish.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-right rounded mx-0 ml-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--right" src="assets/images/game-1/bolton-goal-1.jpg" alt="Bolton striker Dean Holdsworth gives his side an early lead against Ipswich.">
                                        <p>Ipswich fans would be forgiven for thinking the footballing Gods were against them once more.  After narrowly missing out on an automatic spot and having dealt with play-off failure in the 3 previous seasons, they now found themselves 2-0 down with two key players off injured after only 32 minutes.</p>
                                        <p>However, on 36 minutes Marcus Stewart injected some hope.  Holland teed the ball forward to Stewart who allowed the ball to run across him before unleashing a long-range volley into the top-left corner.  Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen got a hand on it but could only parry it onto the underside of the bar on its way in.</p>
                                        <p>Stewart should have drawn Ipswich level in the second half when Scowcroft cushioned a header down to him and from 8 yards, he lashed the ball over.  Jensen would then waste a good opportunity to restore Bolton’s two goal lead by trying to round Ipswich keeper Wright rather than pull the trigger after, allowing Ipswich defenders to get back and clear their lines.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-left rounded mx-0 mr-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--left" src="assets/images/marcus-stewart/marcus-stewart-celebrates-against-bolton-2.jpg" alt="Marcus Stewart celebrates equalising for Ipswich away at Bolton.">
                                        <p>In the 65th minute, Stewart had the chance to make up for his earlier miss.  Some good play down Ipswich’s left between Clapham and Reuser dragged the Bolton back line out of position allowing Reuser to slip through Stewart for a one-on-one against Jaaskelainen.  Ice-cool, Stewart pushed the ball around the Bolton keeper before calmly shifting the ball back onto his preferred left foot to whip the ball into the far left corner of the goal, guiding his shot behind the Bolton defenders who had rushed back to help their stricken keeper.  It was the type of finish Ipswich fans would see the forward repeat several times over the coming seasons; Stewart was often the calmest person in the stadium when through one-on-one with opposition goalkeepers.</p>
                                        <p>Having signed in February of that year, Stewart had only scored two goals during the final months of the season.  Doubling his tally for the season that afternoon meant Ipswich had recovered from a two-goal deficit and there was everything still to play for in the return fixture at Portman Road 3 days later.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Match Summary</h4>
                                    <div class="text-center text-sm-left">
                                        <p>Whilst the first leg had been action packed, the second leg would prove to be one of the most amazing games Portman Road has ever seen.  Prior to kick-off, Ipswich were bolstered by the news that striker David Johnson was fit to start whilst Bolton forward Eidur Gudjohnsen was not in their squad.  The Finnish striker would go on to play at the highest level, joining Chelsea and subsequently Barcelona after leaving Bolton.</p>
                                        <p>However on 6 minutes, Ipswich fell behind after a looping cross was spilled by Wright under pressure and Holdsworth stabbed into an unguarded net from close range. </p>
                                        <p>12 minutes later Holdsworth would be involved in Ipswich’s equaliser by conceding a penalty as he stuck out a trailing leg after being cleverly nutmegged by Magilton in the box.  The Ipswich midfielder would dust himself off to slot the penalty into the bottom left corner to level the match at 1-1.</p>
                                        <p>Once more, Holdsworth was at the center of the action when his free kick whistled past Richard Wright into his bottom right corner to put Bolton ahead in the tie once more on 39 minutes.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-right rounded mx-0 ml-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--right" src="assets/images/game-2/holdsworth-celebrates.jpg" alt="Dean Holdsworth celebrates giving Bolton the lead at Portman Road.">
                                        <p>But before the half was over, Ipswich had another penalty and another chance to equalise.  This time Stewart was on the end of an overly physical tackle in the Bolton box.  Magilton took the spot kick again and went for the same corner as his first, only to see Jaaskelainen guess right and tip round the post.</p>
                                        <p>4 minutes after the restart, Magilton redeemed himself.  Some brilliant footwork in the Bolton box saw him create space to drive the ball across the helpless Jaaskelainen to draw Ipswich level at 2-2 on the night (4-4 on aggregate).</p>
                                        <p>Shortly after, Ipswich found themselves a goal behind for the third time on the night.  Moments after the restart, Bolton midfielder Allan Johnston lashed in an excellent volley.</p>
                                        <p>With 30 minutes left to save their promotion hopes, Ipswich drove forward in search of an equaliser.  Player of the Season James Scowcroft was lost to injury in the 79th minute with Richard Naylor his replacement.  As the clock ticked down, centre back Mowbray was pushed up front as a target man.  In the dying seconds of normal time, Mowbray cushioned a header to the feet of Magilton who drilled the ball into the bottom corner to complete his hattrick and lift the roof off Portman Road!  The goal levelled the tie at 3-3 on the night and 5-5 overall.  Thanks to the law change instigated by Chairman David Sheepshanks the previous summer, Ipswich would not be losing out on the away goals rule this year and would instead be heading into extra-time.</p>
                                        <p>Before extra-time, Bolton would lose their first player of the night when defender Mike Whitlow was given a straight red for bringing down Marcus Stewart from behind.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-left rounded mx-0 mr-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--left" src="assets/images/game-2/clapham-equalises-against-bolton.jpg" alt="Jamie Clapham celebrates giving Ipswich the lead in extra time against Bolton at Portman Road.">
                                        <p>In the 4th minute of extra-time, in keeping with their aggressive play all evening, Bolton player Paul Ritchie lost his composure and needlessly threw David Johnson to the ground with the ball safely in his keepers’ hands.  Ipswich were awarded their 3rd spot kick of the night.  This time left back Jamie Clapham stepped up and put the penalty away to give Ipswich their first lead in the tie.</p>
                                        <p>3 minutes later and Bolton defender Robbie Elliot would join teammate Ritchie for an early bath after a horrible two-footed lunge on Martijn Reuser.  Knight dished out his second yellow card of the game to the Bolton player although a straight red would have been a more fitting punishment.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-right rounded mx-0 ml-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--right" src="assets/images/game-2/bolton-red-card.jpg" alt="Bolton defender Robbie Elliot is shown a red card.">
                                        <p>Finally, a goal and two men up, Ipswich fans could start to enjoy the prospect of a play-off final at Wembley.  Any doubts were quashed when Naylor slipped Reuser through on goal in the 109th minute.  The on-loan Dutch winger raced clear and finished beautifully into the top-right corner to send the home fans into raptures.</p>

                                        <p>Despite having many skilful players, Bolton arrived at Portman Road overly fired up and the game became a feisty affair.  As a team, they were determined to ruffle the feathers of their opponents by any means necessary and argue every decision, often surrounding referee Barry Knight and were fortunate not to have received more than two red cards across the 120 minutes.  But time and time again Ipswich stood up to the tough treatment dealt out to them and continued to play their brand of football to deservedly book their place at Wembley.  At the fourth time of asking, Ipswich had finally made it to the play-off final.  Could they now go one step further and return to the Premier League?</p>

                                    <div class="text-center text-sm-left">
                                        <p>Monday 29th May 2000 was a beautiful sunny May bank holiday and Wembley Way was a sea of blue and red as coach loads of fans descended on the old Twin Towers.  Ipswich Town faced the divisions top scorers Barnsley, in the last ever domestic fixture to take place at the old Wembley Stadium.  Barnsley had finished the season 5 points behind Ipswich in 4th place.  They comfortably overcame Birmingham in their play-off semi-final, running out 5-2 winners on aggregate having won the first leg at Oakwell 4-0.  Ipswich had beaten Barnsley twice during the season; a 6-1 drubbing at Portman Road in August 1999 was followed by a 2-0 victory for the Blues at Oakwell in February 2000.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-right rounded mx-0 ml-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--right" src="assets/images/game-3/hignett-celebrates-at-wembley.jpg" alt="Barnsley midfielder Craig Hignett celebrates giving his team the lead against Ipswicy at Wembley.">
                                        <p>As was the case in the two semi-final games, Ipswich would find themselves a goal down within the opening 10 minutes.  Barnsley’s captain on the day, attacking midfielder Craig Hignett, picked up the ball in the middle of the Ipswich half and unleashed a strike from distance with just 6 minutes on the clock.  The ball thundered off the underside of the bar but on its way out, the ball ricocheted back off a diving Richard Wright and into the Ipswich net.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-left rounded mx-0 mr-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--left" src="assets/images/game-3/david-johnson-against-barnsley.jpg" alt="Ipswich striker David Johnson in action against Barnsley at Wembley.">
                                        <p>Ipswich were already without Player of the Season James Scowcroft, out with a hamstring injury suffered in the semi-final second leg.  Within the opening seconds of the game, fellow striker and top scorer David Johnson was seen clutching his shoulder following a collision with the Barnsley keeper Kevin Miller.  The injury would eventually force him off, with Johnson’s afternoon ending after only 22 minutes as Richard Naylor came on in his place.</p>
                                        <p>Despite being without 2 of their key strikers, Ipswich grew into the game and drew level on 28 minutes.  A half-cleared corner dropped back to Magilton who drifted in a cross which was met by veteran defender Tony Mowbray with a towering header at the back post.  The 36-year-old was making his first appearance at Wembley in what was to be the final game of his career before retirement.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-right rounded mx-0 ml-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--right" src="assets/images/game-3/wright-saves-penalty.jpg" alt="Ipswich goalkeeper saves a penalty against Barnsley at Wembley.">
                                        <p>A period of Ipswich pressure followed but on the stroke of half-time, Ipswich would concede a penalty.  A through ball into the Ipswich box was chased by Hignett who beat the onrushing Richard Wright to the ball.  Despite poking the ball beyond his reach, the Barnsley midfielder cleverly ensured there was contact leaving little choice for referee Terry Heilbron but to award a penalty.  However, England under-21 goalkeeper Wright would redeem himself with a brilliant save from Darren Barnard’s spot kick ensuring the teams went into the break level.</p>
                                        <p>Town grabbed a hold of the tie in the second half with two goals in quick succession.  Now attacking towards the Ipswich fans, Richard Naylor would prove a super-sub by scoring Ipswich’s second in the 52nd minute.  Following a flick on by Marcus Steward from a long ball upfield, the striker reacted quickest to slot in and send the blue half of Wembley wild.  6 minutes later, Naylor brilliantly controlled another long ball into the channel before teeing up Clapham whose cross was met by Stewart’s glancing header into the bottom corner to give Ipswich a 3-1 lead.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-left rounded mx-0 mr-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--left" src="assets/images/game-3/stewart-scores-at-wembley.jpg" alt="Ipswich striker Marcus Stewart scores against Barnsley at Wembley.">
                                        <p>In the 77th minute, Tony Mowbray tangled with Barnsley midfielder Geoff Thomas resulting in Barnsley’s second penalty of the match.  This time, Hignett stepped up to take the penalty and slammed it past Wright to make the score 3-2 and send Suffolk nerves jangling once more.</p>
                                        <p>Burley replaced striker Stewart with midfielder Martijn Reuser.  As Barnsley pushed for an equaliser, Wright was forced into a fantastic point blank save from Gjorgji Hristov’s header to protect Ipswich’s one goal advantage.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-right rounded mx-0 ml-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--right" src="assets/images/game-3/reuser-scores-at-wembley.jpg" alt="Ipswich midfielder Martijn Reuser scores against Barnsley at Wembley.">
                                        <p>Every second felt like a minute and every minute like an hour as the clock ticked slowly towards full-time.  Ipswich’s defence held firm and in the final minute of the 90, Richard Naylor stabbed the ball through to Reuser.  With their entire team caught upfield in search of an equaliser, Reuser had a clear run on the Barnsley goal from the half-way line.  A sea of blue fans, hearts in their mouths, surrounded the Dutchman who had just Barnsley keeper Kevin Miller in his path.  Time seemed to pass slower still as if almost stopping . . . <strong>“Reuser . . . PREMIERSHIP!”</strong>  That memorable line of commentary signalled the start of wild celebrations in Suffolk and even wilder for those Ipswich fans at Wembley.  Reuser slammed the ball in from the edge of the box and Ipswich saw out the final few minutes of added time to win 4-2 and secure their return to the Premier League.</p>
                                        <img class="float-none float-sm-left rounded mx-0 mr-sm-3 mb-3 text-image clear--left" src="assets/images/game-3/burley-lifts-play-off-trophy.jpg" alt="Ipswich manager Georger Burley lifts the play-off trophy at Wembley.">
                                        <p>Never a team to do things the easy way, Ipswich fans had been put through the wringer.  Three years of play-off heartbreak finally felt worth it after the dramatic May 2000 play-off trilogy which included 18 goals over 300 minutes, 5 penalties, 2 red cards, 1 hattrick and saw Ipswich trail in games on 5 separate occasions.  A bus parade and reception in the Town Hall took place in the days following Ipswich’s Wembley win.  The next season, Ipswich would go on to take the Premier League by storm, finishing 5th despite being many pundits’ favourites for relegation.</p>
                                        <p>Fans of the club from sleepy Suffolk have been starved of success in recent years and 20 years on from that day at Wembley, the memories shine brighter than ever.</p>
